          <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hey guys! My name is Ricardo Manosalvas and I am a Full Stack Developer and let me tell you how I got here. I was born 
                in South America and moved to the states when I was just two years old. For practically my whole life I have lived in 
                Northern Virginia. I went to Lynchburg College, now known as University of Lynchburg, to play soccer and graduated with 
                a B.S. in Exercise Physiology.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                After college I moved to Arlington, VA, where I became a personal trainer. During this time I learned a lot about running
                a business and self promotion. After a couple succesful years as a personal trainer I then became a Fitness Manager at a
                gym in Washington, DC, and pushed my team of six personal trainers to grow their own personal busines as I did.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My next step is to be apart of a great team for a company that will help me develop and grow more as a developer.
