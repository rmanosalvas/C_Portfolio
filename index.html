                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hey guys! My name is Ricardo Manosalvas and I am a Full Stack Developer and let me tell you how I got here. I was born 
                        in South America and moved to the states when I was just two years old. For practically my whole life I have lived in 
                        Northern Virginia. I went to Lynchburg College, now known as University of Lynchburg, to play soccer and graduated with 
                        a B.S. in Exercise Physiology.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        After college I moved to Arlington, VA, where I became a personal trainer. During this time I learned a lot about running
                        a business and self promotion. After a couple succesful years as a personal trainer I advanced to a Fitness Manager position in a
                        gym in Washington, DC. Here I used the tools learned during my time as a trainer to lead my team of six and help them promote their own personal brand.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      As a web developer my skills currently include a deep understanding of HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, NodeJS, Express, Mysql, and NoSQL. Check out my GitHub!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        My next step is to be apart of a great team for a company that will help me develop and grow more as a developer.
                    </p>
