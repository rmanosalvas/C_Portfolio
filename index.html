                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    Hey guys! My name is Ricardo Manosalvas and I am a Full Stack Developer and let me tell you how I got here. I was born 
                    in South America and moved to the states when I was just two years old. For practically my whole life I have lived in 
                    Northern Virginia. I went to Lynchburg College, now known as University of Lynchburg, to play soccer and graduated with 
                    a B.S. in Exercise Physiology.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After college I moved to Arlington, VA, where I became a personal trainer. During this time I learned a lot about running
                    a business and self promotion. After a couple succesful years as a personal trainer I then became a Fitness Manager at a
                    gym in Washington, DC, and pushed my team of six personal trainers to grow their own personal busines as I did.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My next step is to be apart of a great team for a company that will help me develop and grow more as a developer.
                </p>
